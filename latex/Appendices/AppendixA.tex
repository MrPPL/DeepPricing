\section{European Call and Put}
The European options will be the most basic options, we will work with. This means not that they are not important, actually they are key for pricing options. The European call option is a contract, which pays at maturity $\Phi(S(T))=max(S-K,0)$.

The European put is very similar to the call, except now we earn, when the stock is below the strike price K.\\
$\Phi(S(T))=max(K-S,0)$.
