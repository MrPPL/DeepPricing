Closed-form solutions for the jump probabilities and the jump amplitudes are obtained. The accuracy of the method is illustrated in the case of European options when there are three underlying assets.},

abstract = {We apply supervised deep neural networks (DNNs) for pricing and calibration
of both vanilla and exotic options under both diffusion and pure jump processes
with and without stochastic volatility. We train our neural network models
under different number of layers, neurons per layer, and various different
activation functions in order to find which combinations work better
empirically. For training, we consider various different loss functions and
optimization routines. We demonstrate that deep neural networks exponentially
expedite option pricing compared to commonly used option pricing methods which
consequently make calibration and parameter estimation super fast.},

show that the deep learning model is accurate and very fast, capable of
producing valuations a million times faster than traditional models. We develop
a methodology to randomly generate appropriate training data and explore the
impact of several parameters including layer width and depth, training data
quality and quantity on model speed and accuracy.},
